# Titanic Project

The aim of this project is to implement and explain various tasks that are common in data science projects. The titanic dataset is ideal for my aim since apart from being fun to work with, it has numeric and categorical data. We will use pandas to deal with the data, we will also use Tensorflow and Scikit Learn to build the ML models and evaluate them. 

I try to do some tasks in different ways, in order to compare the strengths of each of them. For example when computing the missing values of the age feature (numeric), apart from explaining the most common technique (mean value substitution) I also perform two other stronger techniques which should be used whenever it is possible for best performance. 

Several models are built and trained, however after some analysis it is clear that KNN, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost are the best for this project. Hence these are the only ones being hypertuned and evaluated, both things done in several ways.
